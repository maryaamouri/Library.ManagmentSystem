## Library Managment System
I consider Libro one of the most exciting projects I've ever worked on, as libraries and books are personally meaningful to me. I regard this project as the most significant one I've worked on so far. Although it is an API, it holds educational value even if it requires further development to function as a full-fledged program. Stemming from my belief in continuous learning and self-improvement, I consistently update it whenever I acquire new knowledge. Libro has been my best teacher in the last few months.
Libro was the final project of my internship at Foothill. Libro is a comprehensive Book Management System designed to facilitate the easy management and discovery of books in a library setting. The primary focus of this project is to design and implement the web APIs that will support the functionality of this application. These APIs will handle user registration and authentication, book transactions, patron profile management, book and author management, and more.
