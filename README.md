### Library Managment System
I consider Libro one of the most exciting projects I've ever worked on, as libraries and books are personally meaningful to me. I regard this project as the most significant one I've worked on so far. Although it is an API, it holds educational value even if it requires further development to function as a full-fledged program. Stemming from my belief in continuous learning and self-improvement, I consistently update it whenever I acquire new knowledge. Libro has been my best teacher in the last few months.
Libro was the final project of my internship at Foothill. Libro is a comprehensive Book Management System designed to facilitate the easy management and discovery of books in a library setting. The primary focus of this project is to design and implement the web APIs that will support the functionality of this application. These APIs will handle user registration and authentication, book transactions, patron profile management, book and author management, and more.

## **Main Features:**

### **User Registration and Authentication:**
Users should be able to register and log in to the system, and there should be different types of users (patrons, librarians, administrators) with different access levels.

### **Searching and Browsing Books:**

Users should be able to search for books by title, author, genre, and other relevant criteria, and browse all available books. Each book's information page should include details such as its title, author, publication date, genre, and availability status, **and the result should be paginated**

### **Book Transactions:**

Patrons should be able to reserve available books. Librarians should be able to check out books to patrons and accept returned books. The system should keep track of due dates for borrowed books and whether a book is overdue.

### **Patron Profiles:**

Patrons should be able to view their own profile, which includes their borrowing history and any current or overdue loans. Librarians and administrators should be able to view and edit patron profiles.

### **Book and Author Management:**

Librarians and administrators should be able to add, edit, or remove books and authors in the system. Administrators should be able to manage librarian accounts.
